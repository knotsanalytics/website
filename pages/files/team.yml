    - bio: I am a computer and data scientist with a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics.
        During my years in research, I focused on Quantum Gravity and on a
        numerical approach to gravitational physics. Here I developed
        high-performance solutions as well as machine and deep-learning
        algorithms and I explored their possibilities in one of the toughest
        domains of physics.

      bio: I am a machine learning engineer that pursued a Ph.D. in computational
        linguistics. I started data analysis during my master in physics where I
        modeled spatial and neurological data. After I had the opportunity to
        manage, analyze big financial databases, working in the IT sector for
        one of the biggest banks in Italy.
