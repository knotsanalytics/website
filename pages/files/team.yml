    - bio: >-
        I am a computer and data scientist with a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics. 


        During my years in research, I focused on Quantum Gravity and on a numerical approach to gravitational physics. Here I developed high-performance solutions as well as machine and deep-learning algorithms and I explored their possibilities in one of the toughest domains of physics.


        At KNOTS I make the best use of my excellent analytical and numerical background and express my passion for complex problems with simple and elegant solutions.

      bio: >-
        I am a machine learning engineer that pursued a Ph.D. in computational
        linguistics.


        I started data analysis during my master in physics where I modeled spatial and neurological data. After I had the opportunity to manage, analyze big financial databases, working in the IT sector for one of the biggest banks in Italy.


        In my further studies, I joined the DOC2AMU project (a Marie Curie fellowship) where I was able to learn NLP techniques for applied linguistics.


        Every day I use my skills, experience, and enthusiasm as co-founder at KNOTS.
