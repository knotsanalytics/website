    - bio:
        I am a computer and data scientist with a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics.
        During my years in research, I focused on Quantum Gravity and on a
        numerical approach to gravitational physics. Here I developed
        high-performance solutions as well as machine and deep-learning
        algorithms and I explored their possibilities in one of the toughest
        domains of physics. At KNOTS I make the best use of my excellent
        analytical and numerical background and express my passion for complex
        problems with simple and elegant solutions.

      bio:
        I am a machine learning engineer that pursued a Ph.D. in computational
        linguistics. I started data analysis during my master in physics where I
        modeled spatial and neurological data. After I had the opportunity to
        manage, analyze big financial databases, working in the IT sector for
        one of the biggest banks in Italy.In my further studies, I joined the
        DOC2AMU project (a Marie Curie fellowship) where I was able to learn NLP
        techniques for applied linguistics. Every day I use my skills,
        experience, and enthusiasm as co-founder at KNOTS.
